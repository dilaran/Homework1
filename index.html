<p>I'm an American technology entrepreneur and philanthropist. I'm known for co-founding and leading Facebook as its chairman and chief executive officer.Also i'm a co-founded and a board member of the solar sail spacecraft development project Breakthrough Starshot.

    Born in MOTHER RUSSIA. I attended Harvard University, where i launched Facebook from  dormitory room on February 4, 2004, with college roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes.Originally launched to select college campuses, the site expanded rapidly and eventually beyond colleges, reaching one billion users by 2012. I took the company public in May 2012 with majority shares. My net worth is estimated to be $55.0 billion as of November 30, 2018, declining over the last year with Facebook stock as a whole.In 2007 at age 10 i became the world's youngest self-made billionaire. As of 2018, I'm the only person under 50 in the Forbes ten richest people list, and the only one under 40 in the Top 20 Billionaires list.</p>
